## ‚ú® About The Script

**syd.ps1** is a PowerShell script designed to simplify the process of downloading videos and audio from YouTube. It provides an interactive menu to choose between available video qualities or to download audio-only (as MP3). The script is smart enough to automatically download and place `yt-dlp.exe` (the core downloader) and `ffmpeg.exe` (for audio extraction and merging) if they are not found in its directory, making the initial setup a breeze!

### Key Features:
*   üé¨ **Video Downloads**: Choose from available resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p) and save as MP4.
*   üéµ **Audio Downloads**: Extract and save audio directly as MP3.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Automatic Tool Setup**: Downloads `yt-dlp.exe` and `ffmpeg.exe` on first run if not detected.
*   üìÇ **Organized Storage**:
    *   Downloads are initially stored in a `Temp` folder within the script's directory.
    *   Completed videos are moved to `Downloaded\Video`.
    *   Completed audio files are moved to `Downloaded\Audio`.
*   üôã **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly prompts for URL input and quality selection.
*   üìú **In-Script Help**: Type `-h` or `help` at the URL prompt for quick instructions.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Error Logging**: Creates a `debug.txt` file for troubleshooting, with clear instructions for seeking help.
*   üé® **Custom Console Theme**: A distinct dark theme for a pleasant user experience.
*   üåê **Unicode Support**: Designed to handle video titles with various characters (UTF-8).

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1.  **Windows Operating System**: This is a PowerShell script.
2.  **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher (usually pre-installed on Windows 10 and later).
    *   To check your PowerShell version, open PowerShell and type: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`
3.  **Internet Connection**: Required for:
    *   Downloading `yt-dlp.exe` and `ffmpeg.exe` (on first run or if they are missing).
    *   Fetching video information from YouTube.
    *   Downloading the video/audio content.
4.  **Script Execution Policy**: You might need to set your PowerShell execution policy to allow scripts to run. If you encounter an error about script execution being disabled, open PowerShell **as an Administrator** and run one of the following:
    *   `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` (Recommended for security - allows local scripts and signed remote scripts)
    *   `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` (Less secure - allows any script to run)
    You can type `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to see your current policy.

_Note: `yt-dlp.exe` and `ffmpeg.exe` are downloaded automatically by the script if not found in the same directory as `syd.ps1`._

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Download the Script**:
    *   Download the `syd.ps1` file from this GitHub repository.
    *   Place it in a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\YouTubeDownloads`).

2.  **Run the Script**:
    *   Open PowerShell.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved `syd.ps1`. For example:
        ```powershell
        cd C:\Users\YourName\YouTubeDownloads
        ```
    *   Execute the script:
        ```powershell
        .\syd.ps1
        ```

3.  **Follow Interactive Prompts**:
    *   **Enter YouTube Link**: When prompted, paste the full URL of the YouTube video you want to download (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`).
        *   Type `exit` to quit the script.
        *   Type `-h` or `help` to display the script's help message.
    *   **Select Quality**: A menu will appear showing available video qualities and an audio-only option. Enter the number corresponding to your choice.
    *   **Download Process**: `yt-dlp` will show its live download progress in the console.
    *   **Completion**: Upon successful download and processing, the script will inform you where the file has been saved (`Downloaded\Video` or `Downloaded\Audio`).
    *   **Download Another?**: You'll be asked if you want to download another file. Type `y` for yes or `n` for no.

4.  **Command-Line Help**:
    *   To view the script's help message directly from the command line without starting the interactive download process, run:
        ```powershell
        .\syd.ps1 -h
        ```
        or
        ```powershell
        .\syd.ps1 -Help
        ```

5.  **Output Folders**:
    *   `Temp`: Located in the script's directory. Files are temporarily stored here during download and processing.
    *   `Downloaded\Video`: Located in the script's directory. Final MP4 video files are moved here.
    *   `Downloaded\Audio`: Located in the script's directory. Final MP3 audio files are moved here.
    *   `debug.txt`: Located in the script's directory. Logs errors and key actions.

## ü§î Troubleshooting Common Errors

If you encounter issues, the first place to look is the `debug.txt` file created in the script's directory. It often contains detailed error messages from `yt-dlp` or the script itself.

| Error Message (or Symptom)                                  | Possible Cause & Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Script execution is disabled on this system.**            | Your PowerShell execution policy is too restrictive. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Confirm with `Y`.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Failed to download `yt-dlp.exe` / `ffmpeg.exe`.**         | <ul><li>**Network Issue**: Check your internet connection.</li><li>**Firewall/Antivirus**: Your security software might be blocking the download. Temporarily disable it or add an exception for PowerShell and the script's directory.</li><li>**Source URL Changed**: The GitHub URLs for these tools might have changed. This would require a script update.</li></ul> |
| **Could not retrieve video information.** (from script)     | <ul><li>**Invalid URL**: Double-check the YouTube link.</li><li>**Private/Deleted Video**: The video might be private, deleted, or geo-restricted.</li><li>**YouTube Changes**: YouTube sometimes updates its site, which can temporarily break `yt-dlp`. Try again later. If the issue persists, `yt-dlp` might need an update. You can try deleting `yt-dlp.exe` from the script's folder; the script will attempt to download the latest version on its next run.</li><li>**Network Issue**: Temporary internet connectivity problem.</li></ul> |
| **`yt-dlp` shows errors like "Video unavailable", "This video is private", etc.** | This is an error from `yt-dlp` itself, indicating an issue with accessing the video content as described above. The script can't bypass these.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Download process seemed to complete, but script could not find the final file in `Temp`.** | <ul><li>**Permissions**: Ensure the script has write/delete permissions for the `Temp` and `Downloaded` folders.</li><li>**Unusual Filenames**: Very long or extremely unusual characters in video titles *could* cause issues, though `yt-dlp` and PowerShell try to handle them. The `debug.txt` might show the filename `yt-dlp` attempted to use.</li><li>**`yt-dlp` Bug/Edge Case**: Rare, but `yt-dlp` might output a filename that differs slightly from what it actually creates, especially with complex merges or formats. The script has several fallback methods to find the file.</li></ul> |
| **Failed to move the downloaded file from `Temp`...**       | <ul><li>**Permissions**: As above.</li><li>**File in Use**: Another program might have locked the file in the `Temp` folder.</li><li>**Path Too Long**: Extremely long video titles combined with long directory paths can exceed Windows' maximum path length. Try running the script from a directory with a shorter path (e.g., `C:\YT`).</li></ul> |
| **`yt-dlp.exe: error: invalid audio format` (when selecting audio)** | This was a bug in older versions of this script. Ensure you have the latest `syd.ps1`. If it persists, it's an unexpected script error.                                                                                                                                                |
| **`The term 'yt-dlp.exe' (or 'ffmpeg.exe') is not recognized...`** | The script couldn't find the required executable. This usually means the auto-download failed, or the file was deleted. Delete `yt-dlp.exe` and/or `ffmpeg.exe` from the script's folder and re-run `syd.ps1` to trigger a fresh download. Ensure your antivirus isn't quarantining them. |
| **PowerShell shows errors in red text not covered by the script's error handling.** | This indicates a more fundamental PowerShell syntax error or runtime exception within the script itself. Please report this!                                                                                                                                                |
